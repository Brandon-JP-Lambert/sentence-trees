# Sentence Trees

This project provides a simple tool to create ASCII-style tree visualizations for sentences. The main purpose of this tool is to help with linguistic analysis, especially for understanding the structure and relationships between different components of a sentence.

## Overview

Given a sentence, the ASCII Tree Visualizer generates a tree representation that shows the grammatical structure of the sentence. The visualization is designed to be easy to read, with clear horizontal and vertical formatting. The output is in SCSS format, providing a clean and organized view of the sentence structure.

The project is intended to be used in conjunction with generative text tools like ChatGPT, which can provide additional context and understanding for the generated tree visualizations.

## Example Output

Here's an example of the visualization generated by the tool:

```plaintext
(S)
 ├───(NP)
 │    ├───(Det) The
 │    └───(Noun) rapprochement
 ├───(PP)
 │    ├───(P) between
 │    └───(NP)
 ...
 ├───(PP)
 │    ├───(P) for
 │    └───(NP)
 │         ├───(Noun) decades
 └───(.)
```

## Usage

This tool is designed to be used with generative text tools like ChatGPT. Simply edit the prompt with your target sentence to analyze as input, and the prompt will generate a tree visualization similar to the example above.

Please note that this README describes a prompt for generative text tools and does not provide a ready-to-use script or code to create the tree visualization. To create a custom tool that generates these tree visualizations, you will need to implement your own code for parsing and analyzing sentences, as well as for generating the desired output format.
